                             <h3 style="margin-top:-2px"> Pros</h3>
                         
                         <h4>Direct application of learning from the 4 years of technological study </h4>
                         
                         <p>What one had studied in the academics has direct application in the industry. Though, it is not that one will directly apply the learning but the basics are covered in the institute. So, joining a core sector will be in continuation with what have studied here. Do not presume that your 4 years in engineering will not be of any help later.
</p>

<h4>Opportunity to work with diverse skill set people</h4>

<p>As an engineer in core sector, one has to work with unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers as well as with senior management. At times, presentation to VPs and just another time one need to give instructions to the workers with different skill set. Moreover, one also works with people of different nationalities on various occasions.
</p>


<h4> Future of core sectors</h4>
 <p>There are various initiatives and policies of government which would lead to the growth of manufacturing sector in the coming years. The National Manufacturing Policy to raise the share of a manufacturing sector in national GDP from 16% to 25 % and to create 100 million additional jobs by 2022. The initiatives such as “Make in India” will attract more investment to make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. India’s National Steel Policy to reach the production level of Steel from present 80 MTPA to 300 MTPA by 2025 this will create more opportunities for a mechanical graduate. </p>
		<p>This clearly states that Future of a Mechanical graduate is filled with many more different sectors with good employment opportunity all over the India</p>
<h4>Related to greater welfare</h4>

<p>As core sector creates much more jobs. It brings the livelihood to greater proportion of society and has a greater impact on the society in India.</p>

<p>Since ECE is a core branch which have more future options with them after doing their Engineering. They can also go for ESE (Engineering Services Examination).</p>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
<h4>Core sector is not lucrative</h4>
<p>One of the major factors is the remuneration in any industry. It is true that the initial compensation during the start of the career is not up to the par in core when compared to non-core. 
</p>
<p>After joining any core industry, one has to go through the training of minimum 6 months. To understand the whole process of the core industry it takes around 2-3 years. This helps one to grow in the career with knowledge, designation and remuneration. 
</p>
<p>Generally, core sectors are more focused about the commitment on long term orientations example like PF, Perks, Travel allowance, Accommodation, Medical security for self and also for the family. Suppose if one would add their cost along with the salary and all the perks which is the overall remuneration that will be more than most of the non-core or private sector jobs.
</p>

<h4>Core requires only technical knowledge</h4>

<p>There is a belief that core job requires only technical skills, which is actually not true. Soft skills also play a major role in core same like non-core
</p>
<p>For example, one should have good communication to present ideas and also listen to other views or one has to be team player to be able to delegate the jobs and take on responsibility. One should also posses ability to take a logical and analytic approach to solving problems and resolving issues. 
</p>

<h4>Core only a blue collar job</h4>

<p>Core sector jobs indeed require going on shop floor or site but that is not the only job. It is just a small part of a job. One has to do planning and scheduling various plans, Operating procedures in designing for creating safe environment, making a good annual business plan to present to the management board. 
 </p>
		
        
        <h4>Poor growth in core sector</h4>
        
        
        <p>There is a belief that core jobs are dead end jobs and there is no way to become successful. There are many persons who started their career in the core field and did quite well. 
</p>

<h4>Saturation in innovation in core</h4>

<p>It is commonly believed that there is saturation in the innovation in core sector. But it is a wrong assumption. Innovation is a continuous process. Innovation doesn't limit just to develop new products. It also includes solving industrial problem, easing the operating procedure, eliminating the manual work to automated system.

                             <h4>Direct application of learning from the 4 years of technological study</h4>
                             
                             
                             	
<p>What one had studied in the academics has direct application in the industry. Though, it is not that one will directly apply the learning but the basics are covered in the institute. So, joining a core sector will be in continuation with what have studied here. Do not presume that your 4 years in engineering will not be of any help later.</p>
                             <h4>Opportunity to work with diverse skill set people</h4>
          <p>As an engineer in core sector, one has to work with unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers as well as with senior management. At times, presentation to VPs and just another time one need to give instructions to the workers with different skill set. Moreover, one also works with people of different nationalities on various occasions.
</p>                   
                             
                             <h4>Future of core sectors</h4>
                             
              <p>There are various initiatives and policies of government which would lead to the growth of manufacturing sector in the coming years. The National Manufacturing Policy to raise the share of a manufacturing sector in national GDP from 16% to 25 % and to create 100 million additional jobs by 2022. The initiatives such as “Make in India” will attract more investment to make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. </p>
		<p>This clearly states that Future of a civil graduate is filled with many more different sectors with good employment opportunity all over the India 
</p>                
                             <h4> Related to greater welfare</h4>
                             
                  <p>As core sector creates much more jobs. It brings the livelihood to greater proportion of society and has a greater impact on the society in India.
</p>           
                             <h4>Good placement chances for women too</h4>
                <p>There is a blind thought that girls don't prefer Civil, so there are very few colleges in India, where girls are less in strength. But things are changing day by day now one could see equal competition between girls and boys</p>
		<p> Many companies hire only Girls especially from civil background because they are doing good at designing especially for office based jobs.

                             <h4>Entering into ESE or IES</h4>
          <p>Since Civil is a core branch which have more future options with them after doing their Engineering. They can also go for ESE (Engineering Services Examination).

                             <h3>Cons</h3>
                             
                             <h4>Core sector are not lucrative</h4>
         <p>One of the major factors is the remuneration in any industry. It is true that the initial compensation during the start of the career is not up to the par in core when compared to non-core. 
</p>
<p>After joining any core industry, one has to go through the training of minimum 6 months. To understand the whole process of the core industry it takes around 2-3 years. This helps one to grow in the career with knowledge, designation and remuneration. </p>
<p> Generally, core sectors are more focused about the commitment on long term orientations example like PF, Perks, Travel allowance, Accommodation, Medical security for self and also for the family. Suppose if one would add their cost along with the salary and all the perks which is the overall remuneration that will be more than most of the non-core or private sector jobs.

                             <p>There is a belief that core job requires only technical skills, which is actually not true. Soft skills also play a major role in core same like non-core.
</p>
<p>For example, one should have good communication to present ideas and also listen to other views or one has to be team player to be able to delegate the jobs and take on responsibility. One should also posses’ ability to take a logical and analytic approach to solving problems and resolving issues. 
</p>

                             <h4>Core only a blue collar job</h4>
                             
                  <p>Core sector jobs indeed require going on shop floor or site but that is not the only job. It is just a small part of a job. One has to do planning and scheduling various plans, Operating procedures in designing for creating safe environment, making a good annual business plan to present to the management board. 
</p>             
                             <h4>Poor growth in core sector</h4>
                             
                <p>There is a belief that core jobs are dead end jobs and there is no way to become successful. There are many persons who started their career in the core field and did quite well. </p>
		             
                             <h4>Saturation in innovation in core</h4>

<h4>Generation:</h4>
	<p>The companies like AP<strong>Gen</strong>Genco or TS Genco are working for generating electricity using different sources like water, coal, Solar panels etc. Mainly turbines, Generators, Transformers, Circuit breakers etc will be used in the generation part.
</p>

<h4>Transmission:</h4>	
	<p>The companies like AP Transco or TS Transco will take care of transmitting the generated power in an appropriate level. There will be loss of power if we transmit the generated power as it is. So there are some techniques to avoid these losses:</p>
	
	<p>Generated power can’t be transmitted as it is. We have to adjust the voltage levels like increasing or decreasing the voltage by using step up and step down methods. By varying the voltage current also varies.</p>
	<p>The advantage of step up and step down methods is transmitting the voltage with high quality to a maximum number.</p>
	
	<p>Transmitted current should be distributed properly. We use conductors to transmit the current.</p>
	
	<p>Cables and Insulators are mainly used in this transmission process.</p>
	

	<h4>DISCOM: Distribution Companies</h4>
	
	
<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li>These DISCOMs role companies will take care of transmitting the current from substations to different areas with equal voltage.</li>
	
		<li>Transformers, Underground cables, over head cables, Transmission lines are mainly used in these companies.</li>
		
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Companies that comes under DISCOMs:</h4>

<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li>CPDCL - Central power distribution companies Limited </li>
		<li>NPDCL – Northern power distribution companies limited</li>

    <h4>Direct application of learning from the 4 years of technological study</h4>
    
    <p>What one had studied in the academics has direct application in the industry. Though, it is not that one will directly apply the learning but the basics are covered in the institute. So, joining a core sector will be in continuation with what have studied here. Do not presume that your 4 years in engineering will not be of any help later.
</p>

<h4>Opportunity to work with diverse skill set people</h4>
        
<p>As an engineer in core sector, one has to work with unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers as well as with senior management. At times, presentation to VPs and just another time one need to give instructions to the workers with different skill set. Moreover, one also works with people of different nationalities on various occasions.
</p>


<h4>Future of core sectors</h4>
     <p>There are various initiatives and policies of government which would lead to the growth of manufacturing sector in the coming years. The National Manufacturing Policy to raise the share of a manufacturing sector in national GDP from 16% to 25 % and to create 100 million additional jobs by 2022. The initiatives such as “Make in India” will attract more investment to make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. India’s National Steel Policy to reach the production level of Steel from present 80 MTPA to 300 MTPA by 2025 this will create more opportunities for a mechanical graduate. </p>
		<p>This clearly states that Future of a Mechanical graduate is filled with many more different sectors with good employment opportunity all over the India</p>
        
        
        <h4>Related to greater welfare</h4>

<p>As core sector creates much more jobs. It brings the livelihood to greater proportion of society and has a greater impact on the society in India.</p>


<h3>Cons</h3>
<h4>Core sector is not lucrative</h4>

<p>One of the major factors is the remuneration in any industry. It is true that the initial compensation during the start of the career is not up to the par in core when compared to non-core. 
</p>
<p>After joining any core industry, one has to go through the training of minimum 6 months. To understand the whole process of the core industry it takes around 2-3 years. This helps one to grow in the career with knowledge, designation and remuneration. 
</p>
<p>Generally, core sectors are more focused about the commitment on long term orientations example like PF, Perks, Travel allowance, Accommodation, Medical security for self and also for the family. Suppose if one would add their cost along with the salary and all the perks which is the overall remuneration that will be more than most of the non-core or private sector jobs.
</p>


<h4>Core requires only technical knowledge</h4>

<p>There is a belief that core job requires only technical skills, which is actually not true. Soft skills also play a major role in core same like non-core
</p>
<p>For example, one should have good communication to present ideas and also listen to other views or one has to be team player to be able to delegate the jobs and take on responsibility. One should also posses ability to take a logical and analytic approach to solving problems and resolving issues. 
</p>

<h4>Core only a blue collar job</h4>

 <p>Core sector jobs indeed require going on shop floor or site but that is not the only job. It is just a small part of a job. One has to do planning and scheduling various plans, Operating procedures in designing for creating safe environment, making a good annual business plan to present to the management board. 
 </p>

<h4>Poor growth in core sector</h4>

<p>There is a belief that core jobs are dead end jobs and there is no way to become successful. There are many persons who started their career in the core field and did quite well. 
</p>

<h4>Saturation in innovation in core</h4>
<p>It is commonly believed that there is saturation in the innovation in core sector. But it is a wrong assumption. Innovation is a continuous process. Innovation doesn't limit just to develop new products. It also includes solving industrial problem, easing the operating procedure, eliminating the manual work to automated system.

                        <h3 style="margin-top:-2px">Pros</h3>
                         
                         <h4>Direct application of learning from the 4 years of technological study </h4>
                         
                         <p>What one had studied in the academics has direct application in the industry. Though, it is not that one will directly apply the learning but the basics are covered in the institute. So, joining a core sector will be in continuation with what have studied here. Do not presume that your 4 years in engineering will not be of any help later.
</p>

<h4>Opportunity to work with diverse skill set people</h4>

<p>As an engineer in core sector, one has to work with unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers as well as with senior management. At times, presentation to VPs and just another time one need to give instructions to the workers with different skill set. Moreover, one also works with people of different nationalities on various occasions.
</p>


<h4> Future of core sectors</h4>
 <p>There are various initiatives and policies of government which would lead to the growth of manufacturing sector in the coming years. The National Manufacturing Policy to raise the share of a manufacturing sector in national GDP from 16% to 25 % and to create 100 million additional jobs by 2022. The initiatives such as “Make in India” will attract more investment to make India a Global Manufacturing Hub. India’s National Steel Policy to reach the production level of Steel from present 80 MTPA to 300 MTPA by 2025 this will create more opportunities for a mechanical graduate. </p>
		<p>This clearly states that Future of a Mechanical graduate is filled with many more different sectors with good employment opportunity all over the India</p>
<h4>Related to greater welfare</h4>

<p>As core sector creates much more jobs. It brings the livelihood to greater proportion of society and has a greater impact on the society in India.</p>

<p>Since ECE is a core branch which have more future options with them after doing their Engineering. They can also go for ESE (Engineering Services Examination).</p>
		
        <h3>Cons</h3>
<h4>Core sector is not lucrative</h4>
<p>One of the major factors is the remuneration in any industry. It is true that the initial compensation during the start of the career is not up to the par in core when compared to non-core. 
</p>
<p>After joining any core industry, one has to go through the training of minimum 6 months. To understand the whole process of the core industry it takes around 2-3 years. This helps one to grow in the career with knowledge, designation and remuneration. 
</p>
<p>Generally, core sectors are more focused about the commitment on long term orientations example like PF, Perks, Travel allowance, Accommodation, Medical security for self and also for the family. Suppose if one would add their cost along with the salary and all the perks which is the overall remuneration that will be more than most of the non-core or private sector jobs.
</p>

<h4>Core requires only technical knowledge</h4>

<p>There is a belief that core job requires only technical skills, which is actually not true. Soft skills also play a major role in core same like non-core
</p>
<p>For example, one should have good communication to present ideas and also listen to other views or one has to be team player to be able to delegate the jobs and take on responsibility. One should also posses ability to take a logical and analytic approach to solving problems and resolving issues. 
</p>

<h4>Core only a blue collar job</h4>

<p>Core sector jobs indeed require going on shop floor or site but that is not the only job. It is just a small part of a job. One has to do planning and scheduling various plans, Operating procedures in designing for creating safe environment, making a good annual business plan to present to the management board. 
 </p>
		
        
        <h4>Poor growth in core sector</h4>
        
        
        <p>There is a belief that core jobs are dead end jobs and there is no way to become successful. There are many persons who started their career in the core field and did quite well. 
</p>

<h4>Saturation in innovation in core</h4>

<p>It is commonly believed that there is saturation in the innovation in core sector. But it is a wrong assumption. Innovation is a continuous process. Innovation doesn't limit just to develop new products. It also includes solving industrial problem, easing the operating procedure, eliminating the manual work to automated system.
