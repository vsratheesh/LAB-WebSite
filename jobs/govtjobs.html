<p style="margin-top:-2px">Looks like we are back again to the times where Government jobs are opening to get eye-catching. Though the government jobs have frequently been seen as the one with comparatively lesser financial benefits but with the arrival of 6th pay commission, the situation has changed for good.</p>
	
<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li>
		
		<p>The major advantage of Government job is <strong>“Job Security”.</strong></p>
		</li>
		
		<li><p>Now the next momentous reason would that be of the <strong>“Pay construction”
</strong></p></li>
	
		<li><p>Personally we think the next factor an employee would scratch his head over is of the number of  <strong>“Working Hours”.</strong>There are standard working hours, not like private sector ones.
</p></li>
		
		<li><p>An important factor, which any job seeker would take in account, is the <strong>“Promotional benefits”.</strong></p></li>
		
		<li><p>Next comes the <strong>“advantages & perks” </strong> a Government employee gets. 
</p></li>
		
		<li><p>Government sector jobs are <strong>“not at all stressful”</strong> when compared to the jobs in private sector. 
</p> </li>
		
		<li><p>There are more Government <strong>“holidays”</strong> in Government jobs compared to private sector. 
</p></li>
		<li><p>If you are a government employee then you will get <strong>“Respect”</strong> from a division of government employees.
</p></li>
		
		<li><p>In government jobs your <strong>“pay will boost”</strong> which will have no connection with your performance.
</p></li>
		
		<li><p>Next great thing about a government job is you get  <strong>“pension”</strong> after your retirement.
</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To end, the main payback of working with government organizations is the status connected with it on a whole as well as the abundant opportunities coming up in recent times due to planetary growth of Indian Economy.</p>
	
	<p>But Private Sector jobs do have their own rewards as well, and in many cases a Government job may not be correct for an individual.</p>
