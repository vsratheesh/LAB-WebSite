	<p>Civil engineers use drafting (also known as technical drawing) in designing of products and creating instruction for the parts of machines. A technical drawing essentially includes all the dimensions to manufacture a part. It can either be hand-drawn or computer-modelled.</p>

<p>A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. </p>
	
	<h3>2D Modeling</h3>
	<strong>AutoCAD software: </strong>
	
	<p>It helps in 2D drafting and 2D drawing helps one to create and edit technical drawings, as well as annotate designs. These tools are used by drafters in activities such as development of floor plans, building permit drawings, building inspection plans, and landscaping layouts.</p>

	  <ul style="line-height:150%">
	<li>Draft designs more quickly, without using stencils and technical drawing instruments</li>
		<li>Develop site plans, refine concepts, sketch technical drawings, and share ideas</li>

	<p>It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" target="_blank">3D computer graphics</a>,3D modeling (or modeling) is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space_(mathematics)" target="_blank">three-dimensional </a> surface of an object (either inanimate or living) via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics_software" target="_blank">specialized software</a>  The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rendering" target="_blank">3D rendering </a> or used in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation" target="_blank">computer simulation </a> of physical phenomena.

	<p>Models may be created automatically or manually.

      <h3>Core - IT </h3>
    
    
  
    <p>An Electrical engineer is not restricted to automobile/power or allied sectors. As said earlier, there are many fields where an Electrical engineer’s knowledge is applicable. In design, production, manufacturing, supply-chain management and maintenance of machines etc. To understand and implement such projects, one is expected to have knowledge in both Electrical engineering and IT. </p>
    
    <p>Many people after pursuing their B.Tech are going either for higher studies or for IT jobs but core jobs are neglected because lack of information. When we asked people about core jobs their answers were like:</p>
    
 
<ul style="line-height:200%">
        <li>Very few options available</li>
        <li>We are trying but no response from the companies even after cracking the interview.</li>
        <li>No large openings for EEE in core companies</li>
        <li>They will not offer high salaries like IT </li>
        <li>Huge competition of a single post</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>Here we give you the different core jobs that are available, how to get through them, eligibility, career growth, pay pack, etc,.</p>

                 <h3>Core - IT  Overview</h3>
    
    
  
  <p> A Mechanical Engineer is not restricted to automobile/power or allied sectors. As said earlier, there are many fields where a mechanical engineer’s knowledge is applicable. In design, production, manufacturing, supply-chain management and maintenance of machines etc. To understand and implement such projects, one is expected to have knowledge in both mechanical engineering and IT. 
 </p>
 
 

<p>Many people after pursuing their B.Tech are going for higher studies or for IT jobs but they are not applying for core jobs because of lack of information. </p>

<b>When we asked people about core jobs their answer are like:</b>

<ul style="line-height:200%">
	
<li>Very few options available
</li>
	<li>We are trying but no response from the companies even after cracking the interview</li>
	
	<li>No large openings for Mech in core companies
</li>
	
	<li>They will not offer high salaries like IT
</li>
	
	<li>Huge competition of a single post
</li>
  </ul>

                        <h3 style="margin-top:-2px">Eligibility criteria </h3>
                   <p><strong> Academic Qualification: </strong> B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Age Limit:</strong> Varies from company to company but for entry-level it is generally between 21 and 25 years.
</p>
<p><strong>Work Experience:</strong>Either a fresher or one who is experienced can enter the core field. Companies selecting students through on campus interview take freshers while some companies take only experienced candidates.
</p>
<p><strong> Physical Standards:</strong> Core jobs are more physically demanding since you may be required to stand for long hours and perform physically strenuous tasks while working on machines.
</p>       
                          
                          <h3>How to enter?</h3>
          <p><strong>Entrance Exam: </strong> Companies primarily test knowledge in mechanical engineering. Students should be thorough with subjects such as automobile engineering, thermal engineering and tools such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Apply Directly:</strong>Students can apply to companies such as Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Honda, etc., directly after completing B.Tech. The percentage requirement for core sector companies and core roles is generally higher than for non-core roles.
</p>
<p><strong>Through A Reference:</strong>In small companies, you can get in through reference. In some MNCs, special employee referral drives are conducted sometimes while some big companies only accept through recruitment test.
</p>                
                          
                          <h3> How to prepare?</h3>
                  <p><strong>Written Exam: </strong> Depending on the nature of the job and company profile, students may be tested in various subjects such as refrigeration & air conditioning, automotive, Electrical-Mechanical careers etc. For Aptitude and Reasoning refer R S Agarwal.
</p>

<p><strong>Personal Interview:</strong>Revise your core subjects thoroughly, especially those mentioned in the above ‘Entrance Exam’ section and try to gain knowledge on the company (such as company profile, clients, product line, etc.)
</p>          
                          
                          <h3> Skill Set</h3>
                          
             <p>Core companies expect students to be sound with basic concepts of mechanical engineering. Depending on the profile of the company and the role for which the student is being taken, companies may test his/her knowledge on a particular topic.
</p>             
                     
                          
                          
                          <h3> Salary and Perks</h3>
                          
          <p>Top core companies such as Honda, Tata Motors pay decent packages while small companies pay much less. Some core sector roles such as quality engineer have the scope of traveling. In addition to bearing the expenses, companies also provide incentives to engineers.

     <p style="margin-top:-2px">
Mechanical engineers use drafting (also known as technical drawing) in designing of products and creating instruction for the parts of machines. A technical drawing essentially includes all the dimensions to manufacture a part. It can either be hand-drawn or computer-modeled.
</p>

<p>A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information.</p>


<h4>2D Modeling:</h4>

<p>AutoCAD software:<br>
It helps in 2D drafting and 2D drawing helps one to create and edit technical drawings, as well as annotate designs. These tools are used by drafters in activities such as development of floor plans, building permit drawings, building inspection plans, and landscaping layouts.
</p>
<p><strong> Tools used</strong></p>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>
	2D Modeling
	</li>
	<li>AutoCad</li>
</ul>
<h4>3D Modeling:</h4>
<p>It is the 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling (or modeling) is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any three-dimensional surface of an object (either inanimate or living) via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.</p>
<p>Models may be created automatically or manually. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting.</p>
