                   <h3>PSU Overview</h3>


<p>The only jobs that provide a constant source of income are government jobs. PSU’s allow you to get into core sector. If you are into PSUs you get a chance to improve your skills that were learnt in engineering. The possible reasons why people are interested in getting into PSUs are</p>

<ul style="line-height:150%">

	<li>Attractive basic salary which is around 8Lakhs/annum
</li>
<li>Minimal work pressure</li>
<li>Job security </li>
	
</ul>
	<p>
		Though many B.Tech graduates want to get into PSU’s, they really do not have any idea about this sector. Further in this article you will read types of PSU’s, the recruitment procedures, eligibility, career growth etc,.
	</p>
	
	<p>PSUs are divided into 3 categories based on their yearly turn-over of the organization. They are 
</p>

<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li>Maharatna (7)</li>
	<li>Miniratna (17) </li>
	<li>Navaratana (56)</li>

<p><strong>Written Exam:</strong> General Studies/GK – Manorama Year Book, General English – R S Sharma. Computer Engineering –Engineering books. </p>

<p><strong>Personal Interview:</strong> Only some PSU/PSEs have personal interviews. These interviews are generally purely technical in nature. You should also read about company profile.</p>



<h3>Skill Set</h3>


<p>These jobs are primarily technical in nature. However, those who are selected as management trainees will become managers in future. Those selected as MT will be trained by the company as they progress in their career.</p>

<h3> Job Description and Designation</h3>

<h3> Pros and Cons</h3>

<table border="2px solid black">

<tr>
<th>Pros</th>
<th>Cons</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Stable source of income</td>
<td>Slow career growth</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Performance-based incentives</td>
<td>Limited scope</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Pension</td>
<td>Not challenging</td>

</table>

<h3>The Don’ts</h3>

<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>Lose patience. In PSUs, career growth may not be as fast as in private companies. <li>
<li> Despair with posting in remote areas. Though in initial years, you’ll be posted in remote areas, as you grow in career, you’ll be posted in metro areas.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Career Switch </h3>
<p>You can enter IES, private sector companies or with the experience of working in public sector, you can choose other careers such as Civil Services, etc.</p>

The reason why PSUs are important is by getting job in PSUs you can get a chance to work with some of the biggest firms in India.

    <ul style="line-height:200%">
        <li>By joining in PSU you can get a good salary in core sector it is around 8 lakhs per annum where as very few private core companies go for such package.</li>
        <li>Work pressure will be less when compared to private sector jobs.</li>
        <li>Job security which is more important for a middle class family.</li>

  <p style="margin-top:-2px">Most of the PSU companies recruiting students on the basis of GATE score. So you need to prepare well for GATE exam as the competition is very tough you need to put the best efforts to get the job in PSUs.  Apart from core subjects you need to learn General awareness, English and Aptitude, in Computer Engineering most important topics are operating system, databse, automata theory and compiler design etc,. </p>
    
    <p>If your aim is to get in to PSUs make sure that you get a rank below 200 in GATE. To get good rank in you have to answer maximum questions and score more. While preparing for GATE doesn’t skip any subjects. Try to solve previous year GATE papers it will help you a lot, you will get clear idea about important topics and difficulty level by solving previous papers. Always revise the studied topics.</p>

                               <p style="margin-top:-2px"> Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h2>What to study for interviews?</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
  <ul style="line-height:200%">

        <li><strong>Technical – </strong>Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Reasoning – </strong>R S Agarwal</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:-2px">Most of the PSU companies recruit students on the basis of GATE score. So you need to prepare well for GATE exam. As the competition is very tough you need to put the best efforts to get the job in PSUs.  Apart from core subjects you need to learn general awareness, English and aptitude, in civil engineering most important topics are strength of material, manufacturing, applied thermodynamics.</p>
    
    <p>If your aim is to get in to PSUs make sure that you get a rank below 200 in GATE. To get good rank in GATE you have to answer maximum questions and score more. While preparing for GATE it is advisable not to skip any subjects to get good score. Try to solve previous year GATE papers it will help you a lot, you will get clear idea about important topics and difficulty level by solving previous papers. Always revise the studied topics.</p>
    
    <p>PSUs majorly hire through GATE, though they have immediate requirement they will hire through previous GATE score and suppose to attend Personal or Group discussion, but the short listing criteria will be GATE rank.</p>

                          <p style="margin-top:-2px">Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h2>What to study for interviews?</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:150%">
    
        <li><strong>Technical – </strong>Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Reasoning – </strong>R S Agarwal</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:-2px">Most of the PSU companies recruiting students on the basis of GATE score. So you need to prepare well for GATE exam as the competition is very tough you need to put the best efforts to get the job in PSUs.  Apart from core subjects you need to learn General awareness, English and Aptitude, in Computer Engineering most important topics are operating system, databse, automata theory and compiler design etc,. </p>
    
    <p>If your aim is to get in to PSUs make sure that you get a rank below 200 in GATE. To get good rank in you have to answer maximum questions and score more. While preparing for GATE doesn’t skip any subjects. Try to solve previous year GATE papers it will help you a lot, you will get clear idea about important topics and difficulty level by solving previous papers. Always revise the studied topics.</p>
