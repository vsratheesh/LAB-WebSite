              	 <p style="margin-top:-2px">The initial position for which the candidates who qualified IES are recruited would be the Assistant Director/Assistant Executive Engineer or equivalent. The promotions will be based on many factors including the IES Rank, work performance, confidential reports and seniority. The common designations are:</p>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>Assistant Executive Engineer</li>
	
	<li>Assistant Works Manager</li>
	
	<li>Assistant Director</li>

</ul>

<h4>Job Description: </h4>

<p>In PSUs, higher level management roles are generally assumed by senior-level employees and new entrants will mostly have to deal with technical tasks. However, for engineers recruited through IES have both technical and administrative dimensions go hand in hand right from the entry level.</p>


<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li>The IES officer would have handle situations related co-ordination with various organs of the PE, communication with the government authorities.</li>
	
	
	<li>Good relationship with other similar Public Enterprises or private parties, etc.</li>
	
	<li>Decisions related procurement, product specification and verification, expansion and scrutiny of public works sanctioned by the government, etc., lie with the IES.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thus, the IES is as good as being an administrative officer within a government department.  Of course, the range of operations carried by these Public Enterprises requires technical knowledge application and that is why only engineers are recruited as IES. </p>

		<p> The initial position for which the candidates who qualified IES are recruited would be the Assistant Director/Assistant Executive Engineer or equivalent. The promotions will be based on many factors including the IES Rank, work performance, confidential reports and seniority. The common designations are:</p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:200%">
        <li>Assistant Executive Engineer</li>
        <li>Assistant Works Manager</li>
        <li>Assistant Director</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Job Description: </h2>
    
    <p>In PSUs, higher level management roles are generally assumed by senior-level employees and new entrants will mostly have to deal with technical tasks. However, for engineers recruited through IES have both technical and administrative dimensions go hand in hand right from the entry level.</p>
   
 <ul style="line-height:150%">
       <li>The IES officer would have handle situations related co-ordination with various organs of the PE, communication with the government authorities.</li>
       <li>Good relationship with other similar Public Enterprises or private parties, etc.</li>
       <li>Decisions related procurement, product specification and verification, expansion and scrutiny of public works sanctioned by the government, etc., lie with the IES.</li>
       
   </ul>
   <p>Thus, the IES is as good as being an administrative officer within a government department.  Of course, the range of operations carried by these Public Enterprises requires technical knowledge application and that is why only engineers are recruited as IES. </p>

              	<p style="margin-top:-2px">The initial position for which the candidates who qualified IES are recruited would be the Assistant Director/Assistant Executive Engineer or equivalent.

<ul style="lenght-height:200%">

	<p>In PSUs, higher level management roles are generally assumed by senior-level employees and new entrants will mostly have to deal with technical tasks.

	<li>The IES officer would have handle situations related co-ordination with various organs of the PE, communication with the government authorities.</li>

		<li>Decisions related procurement, product specification and verification, expansion and scrutiny of public works sanctioned by the government, etc., lie with the IES.</li>
