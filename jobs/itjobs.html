<h3> The Don’ts</h3>
<p>Don’t stop learning. Technology is advancing very fast and you are supposed to be on your toes all the time. So, never be content with what you know.</p>

<p> Don’t let stress control your life. Stress in IT jobs is very common and will become unmanageable if you don’t give your personal life the time it deserves.</p>
<p> Don’t get stuck with one company. Remember that IT companies are always on look out for talented people and are willing to pay how much ever you demand if you have the right talent.</p>


<h3> Career Switch </h3>


<p> The IT industry has many technical, functional and techno-functional roles. As you progress in career, your role in your organization will become more functional than technical.</p>

<p> Within the company, you can switch from one role to another.</p>

<p>You can move to other industry with your technical knowledge. For example, you can join government departments/companies (such as National Informatics Centre) as an application developer.</p>

<p>You can join reputed engineering/MBA colleges as a faculty member</p>

                            <p >Well the primary employer for CSE/IT graduates is the IT industry. It is quite possible that you might have chosen CSE/IT branch in your engineering with the intention of becoming a software engineer/developer/programmer. Here are some of the advantages of getting into IT</p>
    
                            <ul style="line-height:200%">
                                <li><strong>Well-paying job –</strong> IT industry offers very competitive salaries. On an average, the salary paid to a software engineer is definitely far more than that is paid to non-IT employees.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Great scope to learn – </strong>Technology is progressing at a rapid pace and every company is in a continuous battle with its competitors. Continuous learning is sine qua non (absolutely essential) for someone who wants to continue and make progress in the IT industry. Also, the more you learn, the more your market value will increase.</li>
                                <li><strong>Desk job –</strong> Unlike entry-level jobs for Civil, Mechanical and Electrical engineers, IT engineers need not exert physically for performing their job well. Though it is cited as a cause of many lifestyle diseases among techies, desk job is still preferred by most people.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Onsite opportunities –</strong> Most major service-based IT companies have good number of onsite opportunities. The company will bear all the expenses for your visit to client’s location. Such kinds of opportunities are rare for other entry-level engineering jobs.</li>

                                    <li><p><strong>At least one programming language</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is generally believed by students that they should master an advanced programming language like Java. However, companies do not expect freshers to be experts in anything. They only expect them to be strong in basics of what they have learnt in college. So, it is advised that students thoroughly revise basics of whichever language (C, C++, Java, etc.) they have studied in college.

                            <p>Since it is not guaranteed that you will be given the role of a developer only, you need to be prepared with basics of database also.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p><strong>UNIX scripting commands</strong></p>
                            <p>Since most of the servers are Unix-based, employees working in any role are required to have basic knowledge of UNIX commands as they have work on such servers at some time or another. Moreover, freshers may also be taken in the role of UNIX administrator in which they are supposed have a sound understanding on UNIX scripting concepts.
                            </p>

                                <p>In addition to the above, you need to have strong arithmetic and reasoning skills to become a good programmer. The standard book for refreshing these skills is R S Agarwal. Further, you can solve puzzles by Shakuntala Devi and other noted authors.
                            </p>
                                
                                
                                <h2>Points to be noted</h2>
                                <ul style="line-height:200%">
                                <li>Most students generally study only for exams. Only in 4th year they focus on placements. However, it is advised that students should study constantly keep revising the concepts of ‘C’ and Java.</li>
                                <li>Since C is studied in the first year itself, students should keep practicing C programs in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years also.</li>
                                <li>By the time you study Java in the 2nd year, you must be thorough with basic concepts of programming.</li>
                                <li>In 3rd or 4th year, try to develop a simple application based on Java. Ensure that everything from front-end to back-end is developed by you. The idea is to get a clear picture of complete application development process.</li>
                                
                                </ul>

                         <p style="margin-top:-2px">Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h2>What to study for interviews?</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:200%">
    
        <li><strong>Technical – </strong>Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Reasoning – </strong>R S Agarwal</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

		<h2 style="margin-top:-2px">Careers in IT can be classified under the following heads:</h2>
		<img src="..\images\eee\cse-it-itjobs-ui.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:10px;width:300px">
  
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> User Interface (UI)</li>
		<li>Middleware</li>
		<li>Database</li>
		<li>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</li>
	
	</ul>
	<p>Each of the above career paths are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>A user interface designer’s primary responsibility is to design software applications, websites, mobile apps, etc. with a view to enhance user experience and engagement. The most important rule is end-user, since the success of a software or an app depends largely on its design. The job of a UI designer entails understanding both computer programming and graphic design. UI designers collaborate with product managers and developers to define and implement solutions for the product direction, visuals and experience. Once the creation of a website is complete, designers maintain and make necessary changes to the website when required.
</p>
	
	<strong>The Technologies on which UI designers/engineers work area:</strong>
	
<ul style="line-height:150%">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Photoshop</li>
		<li>Scripting languages – PHP, Java scripting</li>
		<li>Angular JS</li>
		<li>Word Press, Jhumla, etc., which are useful for web designing</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Middleware</h3>

          <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-middleware.jpg" style="float:right">  
		
		<p>Middleware acts as intermediary between the front-end (UI) and database. It is also used for connecting different components of software or different applications. Middleware technologies include </p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>.Net</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Node JS and</li>
			<li>Ruby, among others.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you wish to become a developer, you have to invest your efforts in learning any of the aforementioned technologies.</p>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
<img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-database.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;height:270px"> 
		<p>Database developers and administrators play a very important role in any company which is driven by data. All the data that an application gathers will be stored in a database and it is DB developers and administrators who design the database, decide how this data should be organized and test the database applications.</p>
		
		
		<p>Following are roles for Freshers in database development and administration:</p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>PL/SQL developer</li>
			<li>Database Administrator (DBA) (includes application support)</li>
			<li>DB Tools – Warehousing (ETL/OLAP), Mining</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h3>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</h3>

          <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-networking.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px">  
		
		
		<p>In addition to developers, testers, database engineers, an IT company also require personnel for managing their IT infrastructure such as servers, network devices, desktop/laptops, etc. IMS staff supports others by resolving their issues with IT infrastructure. However, since 2008-9, many IT companies US and Europe-based companies have started outsourcing IMS services. As a result, many major IT companies in India such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc. now provide remote (cloud-based) IMS support. In fact, all the cloud-based services (Saas, Iaas and Paas) today have come to be called as IMS services.</p>

<strong>IMS includes following designations:</strong>
<ul style="line-height:150%">
	<li> <strong>System Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating, troubleshooting Windows/Linux/Unix servers, desktops and laptops</li>
	<li><strong>Network Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting of network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Database Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting databases.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p> In addition to the above mentioned four major career paths, there are a few more options in IT. They are:</p>

<h4> Quality Analyst</h4>
<p>This primarily includes manual testing. Manual testers closely work with the development team for debugging the code.</p>
		
<h4> Enterprise Resource Planning</h4>

<p>Large enterprises use ERP software to manage their business activities. ERP applications help businesses make data-driven and coordinated decisions so that wasteful use of resources is avoided. Some of the ERP applications include:</p>		
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li> SAP</li>
		<li>Oracle Apps</li>
		<li>JD Edwards</li>
		<li>PeopleSoft</li>
	</ul>
		
	<strong>In ERP domain, there are three roles primarily. They are:</strong>
	
	<p> Technical Consultant – Deals with technical aspects such as coding, testing, DB administration, etc.</p>	
		
	<p>Functional Consultant – Deals with requirement gathering from client, planning, implementation, validation, end-user training, etc. It resembles the role of a Business Analyst.</p>	
		
		<p>Techno-functional Consultant – Includes both technical and functional tasks.</p>
		
		
		<p> The above list includes all different careers which a fresher can enter into. However, there are specific designations which are reserved for experienced people. A brief description of different roles and what they hold for Freshers:</p>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> Programming – Many opportunities for Freshers</li>
		<li>SQL with Unix – Support</li>
		<li>Testing – Please note that Freshers can only get into manual testing. Many dubious institutes in Ameerpet claim that Freshers can get into automated testing. We strongly advise that Freshers should not waste their time learning tools such as QTP as no company hires Freshers for these roles because of work as an automated tester, one needs to have a minimum of 1 year of experience in manual testing.</li>

Nowadays many people are looking for IT jobs even though they are from non IT branches. The skills one should have to get a software job are </p>
    
<ul style="line-height:200%">

<li> One programming language (C or JAVA)</li>
<li>Data base concepts</li>
<li>  Basics of Linux operating system</li>
<li>Good problem solving and analytical skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the students will think that by learning the programming languages (like C, JAVA etc.) only they can get software jobs, but there are other jobs in IT like</p>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
<li> HTML, CSS (Graphic Designer)</li>
<li>Database and DBA</li>
<li>System Admin (Windows/ Linux)</li>

                                <li><strong>Well-paying job –</strong> IT industry offers very competitive salaries. On an average, the salary paid to a software engineer is definitely far more than that is paid to non-IT employees.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Great scope to learn – </strong>Technology is progressing at a rapid pace and every company is in a continuous battle with its competitors. Continuous learning is sine qua non (absolutely essential) for someone who wants to continue and make progress in the IT industry. Also, the more you learn, the more your market value will increase.</li>
                                <li><strong>Desk job –</strong> Unlike entry-level jobs for Civil, Mechanical and Electrical engineers, IT engineers need not exert physically for performing their job well. Though it is cited as a cause of many lifestyle diseases among techies, desk job is still preferred by most people.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Onsite opportunities –</strong> Most major service-based IT companies have good number of onsite opportunities. The company will bear all the expenses for your visit to client’s location. Such kinds of opportunities are rare for other entry-level engineering jobs.</li>

                            <p>Since most of the servers are Unix-based, employees working in any role are required to have basic knowledge of UNIX commands as they have work on such servers at some time or another. Moreover, freshers may also be taken in the role of UNIX administrator in which they are supposed have a sound understanding on UNIX scripting concepts.

        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

 	<h2 style="margin-top:-2px">Careers in IT can be classified under the following heads:</h2>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> User Interface (UI)</li>
		<li>Middleware</li>
		<li>Database</li>
		<li>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</li>
	
	</ul>
	<p>Each of the above career paths are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>A user interface designer’s primary responsibility is to design software applications, websites, mobile apps, etc. with a view to enhance user experience and engagement. The most important rule is end-user, since the success of a software or an app depends largely on its design. The job of a UI designer entails understanding both computer programming and graphic design. UI designers collaborate with product managers and developers to define and implement solutions for the product direction, visuals and experience. Once the creation of a website is complete, designers maintain and make necessary changes to the website when required.
</p>
	
	<strong>The Technologies on which UI designers/engineers work area:</strong>
	
<ul style="line-height:150%">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Photoshop</li>
		<li>Scripting languages – PHP, Java scripting</li>
		<li>Angular JS</li>
		<li>Word Press, Jhumla, etc., which are useful for web designing</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Middleware</h3>

          <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-middleware.jpg" style="float:right">  
		
		<p>Middleware acts as intermediary between the front-end (UI) and database. It is also used for connecting different components of software or different applications. Middleware technologies include </p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>.Net</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Node JS and</li>
			<li>Ruby, among others.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you wish to become a developer, you have to invest your efforts in learning any of the aforementioned technologies.</p>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
<img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-database.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;height:270px"> 
		<p>Database developers and administrators play a very important role in any company which is driven by data. All the data that an application gathers will be stored in a database and it is DB developers and administrators who design the database, decide how this data should be organized and test the database applications.</p>
		
		
		<p>Following are roles for Freshers in database development and administration:</p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>PL/SQL developer</li>
			<li>Database Administrator (DBA) (includes application support)</li>
			<li>DB Tools – Warehousing (ETL/OLAP), Mining</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h3>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</h3>

          <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-networking.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px">  
		
		
		<p>In addition to developers, testers, database engineers, an IT company also require personnel for managing their IT infrastructure such as servers, network devices, desktop/laptops, etc. IMS staff supports others by resolving their issues with IT infrastructure. However, since 2008-9, many IT companies US and Europe-based companies have started outsourcing IMS services. As a result, many major IT companies in India such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc. now provide remote (cloud-based) IMS support. In fact, all the cloud-based services (Saas, Iaas and Paas) today have come to be called as IMS services.</p>

<strong>IMS includes following designations:</strong>
<ul style="line-height:150%">
	<li> <strong>System Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating, troubleshooting Windows/Linux/Unix servers, desktops and laptops</li>
	<li><strong>Network Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting of network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Database Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting databases.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p> In addition to the above mentioned four major career paths, there are a few more options in IT. They are:</p>

<h4> Quality Analyst</h4>
<p>This primarily includes manual testing. Manual testers closely work with the development team for debugging the code.</p>
		
<h4> Enterprise Resource Planning</h4>

<p>Large enterprises use ERP software to manage their business activities. ERP applications help businesses make data-driven and coordinated decisions so that wasteful use of resources is avoided. Some of the ERP applications include:</p>		
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li> SAP</li>
		<li>Oracle Apps</li>
		<li>JD Edwards</li>
		<li>PeopleSoft</li>
	</ul>
		
	<strong>In ERP domain, there are three roles primarily. They are:</strong>
	
	<p> Technical Consultant – Deals with technical aspects such as coding, testing, DB administration, etc.</p>	
		
	<p>Functional Consultant – Deals with requirement gathering from client, planning, implementation, validation, end-user training, etc. It resembles the role of a Business Analyst.</p>	
		
		<p>Techno-functional Consultant – Includes both technical and functional tasks.</p>
		
		
		<p> The above list includes all different careers which a fresher can enter into. However, there are specific designations which are reserved for experienced people. A brief description of different roles and what they hold for Freshers:</p>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> Programming – Many opportunities for Freshers</li>
		<li>SQL with Unix – Support</li>
		<li>Testing – Please note that Freshers can only get into manual testing. Many dubious institutes in Ameerpet claim that Freshers can get into automated testing. We strongly advise that Freshers should not waste their time learning tools such as QTP as no company hires Freshers for these roles because of work as an automated tester, one needs to have a minimum of 1 year of experience in manual testing.</li>

Nowadays many people are looking for IT jobs even though they are from non IT branches. The skills one should have to get a software job are </p>
    
<ul style="line-height:200%">

<li> One programming language (C or JAVA)</li>
<li>Data base concepts</li>
<li>  Basics of Linux operating system</li>
<li>Good problem solving and analytical skills</li>

Continuous learning is sine qua non (absolutely essential) for someone who wants to continue and make progress in the IT industry. Also, the more you learn, the more your market value will increase.</li>
                                <li>Desk job – Unlike entry-level jobs for Civil, Mechanical and Electrical engineers, IT engineers need not exert physically for performing their job well. Though it is cited as a cause of many lifestyle diseases among techies, desk job is still preferred by most people.</li>
                                
                                <li>Onsite opportunities – Most major service-based IT companies have good number of onsite opportunities. The company will bear all the expenses for your visit to client’s location. Such kinds of opportunities are rare for other entry-level engineering jobs.</li>

However, companies do not expect freshers to be experts in anything. They only expect them to be strong in basics of what they have learnt in college. So, it is advised that students thoroughly revise basics of whichever language (C, C++, Java, etc.) they have studied in college.

                                <li>Since C is studied in the first year itself, students should keep practicing C programs in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years also.</li>
                                <li>By the time you study Java in the 2nd year, you must be thorough with basic concepts of programming.</li>
                                <li>In 3rd or 4th year, try to develop a simple application based on Java. Ensure that everything from front-end to back-end is developed by you. The idea is to get a clear picture of complete application development process.</li>

		  <p style="margin-top:-2px">Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h3>What to study for interviews?</h3>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
    <ul style="length-height:200%">
        <li>Technical – Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li>Arithmetic and Reasoning – R S Agarwal</li>
        <li>Soft Skills – This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <p>Where to take recruitment training?</p>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

	    <div class="tab-content paragraph-style pull-left text-left">
		<h2 style="margin-top:-2px">Careers in IT can be classified under the following heads:</h2>
		<img src="..\civil\jobs\images\cse-it-itjobs-ui.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:10px">
      
         
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> User Interface (UI)</li>
		<li>Middleware</li>
		<li>Database</li>
		<li>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</li>
	
	</ul>
	<p>Each of the above career paths are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>A user interface designer’s primary responsibility is to design software applications, websites, mobile apps, etc. with a view to enhance user experience and engagement. The most important rule is end-user, since the success of a software or an app depends largely on its design. The job of a UI designer entails understanding both computer programming and graphic design. UI designers collaborate with product managers and developers to define and implement solutions for the product direction, visuals and experience. Once the creation of a website is complete, designers maintain and make necessary changes to the website when required.
</p>
	
	<strong>The Technologies on which UI designers/engineers work area:</strong>
	
<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Photoshop</li>
		<li>Scripting languages – PHP, Java scripting</li>
		<li>Angular JS</li>
		<li>Word Press, Jhumla, etc., which are useful for web designing</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Middleware</h3>

         <img src="..\civil\jobs\images\cse-itjobs-middleware.jpg" style="float:right">  
		
		<p>Middleware acts as intermediary between the front-end (UI) and database. It is also used for connecting different components of software or different applications. Middleware technologies include </p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>.Net</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Node JS and</li>
			<li>Ruby, among others.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you wish to become a developer, you have to invest your efforts in learning any of the aforementioned technologies.</p>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
		  <img src="..\civil\jobs\images\cse-itjobs-database.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;height:270px">   
		<p>Database developers and administrators play a very important role in any company which is driven by data. All the data that an application gathers will be stored in a database and it is DB developers and administrators who design the database, decide how this data should be organized and test the database applications.</p>
		
		
		<p>Following are roles for Freshers in database development and administration:</p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>PL/SQL developer</li>
			<li>Database Administrator (DBA) (includes application support)</li>
			<li>DB Tools – Warehousing (ETL/OLAP), Mining</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h3>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</h3>

         <img src="..\civil\jobs\images\cse-itjobs-networking.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px">  
		<p>In addition to developers, testers, database engineers, an IT company also require personnel for managing their IT infrastructure such as servers, network devices, desktop/laptops, etc. IMS staff supports others by resolving their issues with IT infrastructure. However, since 2008-9, many IT companies US and Europe-based companies have started outsourcing IMS services. As a result, many major IT companies in India such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc. now provide remote (cloud-based) IMS support. In fact, all the cloud-based services (Saas, Iaas and Paas) today have come to be called as IMS services.</p>

<strong>IMS includes following designations:</strong>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li> <strong>System Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating, troubleshooting Windows/Linux/Unix servers, desktops and laptops</li>
	<li><strong>Network Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting of network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Database Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting databases.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p> In addition to the above mentioned four major career paths, there are a few more options in IT. They are:</p>

<h4> Quality Analyst</h4>
<p>This primarily includes manual testing. Manual testers closely work with the development team for debugging the code.</p>
		
<h4> Enterprise Resource Planning</h4>

<p>Large enterprises use ERP software to manage their business activities. ERP applications help businesses make data-driven and coordinated decisions so that wasteful use of resources is avoided. Some of the ERP applications include:</p>		
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li> SAP</li>
		<li>Oracle Apps</li>
		<li>JD Edwards</li>
		<li>PeopleSoft</li>
	</ul>
		
	<strong>In ERP domain, there are three roles primarily. They are:</strong>
	
	<p> Technical Consultant – Deals with technical aspects such as coding, testing, DB administration, etc.</p>	
		
	<p>Functional Consultant – Deals with requirement gathering from client, planning, implementation, validation, end-user training, etc. It resembles the role of a Business Analyst.</p>	
		
		<p>Techno-functional Consultant – Includes both technical and functional tasks.</p>
		
		
		<p> The above list includes all different careers which a fresher can enter into. However, there are specific designations which are reserved for experienced people. A brief description of different roles and what they hold for Freshers:</p>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> Programming – Many opportunities for Freshers</li>
		<li>SQL with Unix – Support</li>
		<li>Testing – Please note that Freshers can only get into manual testing. Many dubious institutes in Ameerpet claim that Freshers can get into automated testing. We strongly advise that Freshers should not waste their time learning tools such as QTP as no company hires Freshers for these roles because of work as an automated tester, one needs to have a minimum of 1 year of experience in manual testing.</li>

Nowadays many people are looking for IT jobs even though they are from non IT branches. The skills one should have to get a software job are </p>
    
<ul style="line-height:200%">

<li> One programming language (C or JAVA)</li>
<li>Data base concepts</li>
<li>  Basics of Linux operating system</li>
<li>Good problem solving and analytical skills</li>

                                <li><strong>Well-paying job –</strong> IT industry offers very competitive salaries. On an average, the salary paid to a software engineer is definitely far more than that is paid to non-IT employees.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Great scope to learn – </strong>Technology is progressing at a rapid pace and every company is in a continuous battle with its competitors. Continuous learning is sine qua non (absolutely essential) for someone who wants to continue and make progress in the IT industry.

                                <li><strong>Desk job –</strong> Unlike entry-level jobs for Civil, Mechanical and Electrical engineers, IT engineers need not exert physically for performing their job well. Though it is cited as a cause of many lifestyle diseases among techies, desk job is still preferred by most people.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Onsite opportunities –</strong> Most major service-based IT companies have good number of onsite opportunities. The company will bear all the expenses for your visit to client’s location. Such kinds of opportunities are rare for other entry-level engineering jobs.</li>

                                <p>In addition to the above, you need to have strong arithmetic and reasoning skills to become a good programmer. The standard book for refreshing these skills is R S Agarwal. Further, you can solve puzzles by Shakuntala Devi and other noted authors.

                                <li>Most students generally study only for exams. Only in 4th year they focus on placements. However, it is advised that students should study constantly keep revising the concepts of ‘C’ and Java.</li>
                                <li>Since C is studied in the first year itself, students should keep practicing C programs in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years also.</li>
                                <li>By the time you study Java in the 2nd year, you must be thorough with basic concepts of programming.</li>
                                <li>In 3rd or 4th year, try to develop a simple application based on Java. Ensure that everything from front-end to back-end is developed by you. The idea is to get a clear picture of complete application development process.</li>

                          <p style="margin-top:-2px">Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h2>What to study for interviews?</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:150%">
    
        <li><strong>Technical – </strong>Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Reasoning – </strong>R S Agarwal</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

 	<h2 style="margin-top:-2px">Careers in IT can be classified under the following heads:</h2>
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> User Interface (UI)</li>
		<li>Middleware</li>
		<li>Database</li>
		<li>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</li>
	
	</ul>
	<p>Each of the above career paths are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>A user interface designer’s primary responsibility is to design software applications, websites, mobile apps, etc. with a view to enhance user experience and engagement. The most important rule is end-user, since the success of a software or an app depends largely on its design. The job of a UI designer entails understanding both computer programming and graphic design. UI designers collaborate with product managers and developers to define and implement solutions for the product direction, visuals and experience. Once the creation of a website is complete, designers maintain and make necessary changes to the website when required.
</p>
	
	<strong>The Technologies on which UI designers/engineers work area:</strong>
	
<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Photoshop</li>
		<li>Scripting languages – PHP, Java scripting</li>
		<li>Angular JS</li>
		<li>Word Press, Jhumla, etc., which are useful for web designing</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Middleware</h3>

         <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-middleware.jpg" style="float:right">  
		
		<p>Middleware acts as intermediary between the front-end (UI) and database. It is also used for connecting different components of software or different applications. Middleware technologies include </p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>.Net</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Node JS and</li>
			<li>Ruby, among others.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you wish to become a developer, you have to invest your efforts in learning any of the aforementioned technologies.</p>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
		  <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-database.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;height:270px">   
		<p>Database developers and administrators play a very important role in any company which is driven by data. All the data that an application gathers will be stored in a database and it is DB developers and administrators who design the database, decide how this data should be organized and test the database applications.</p>
		
		
		<p>Following are roles for Freshers in database development and administration:</p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:150%">
			<li>PL/SQL developer</li>
			<li>Database Administrator (DBA) (includes application support)</li>
			<li>DB Tools – Warehousing (ETL/OLAP), Mining</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h3>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</h3>

         <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-networking.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px">  
		<p>In addition to developers, testers, database engineers, an IT company also require personnel for managing their IT infrastructure such as servers, network devices, desktop/laptops, etc. IMS staff supports others by resolving their issues with IT infrastructure. However, since 2008-9, many IT companies US and Europe-based companies have started outsourcing IMS services. As a result, many major IT companies in India such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc. now provide remote (cloud-based) IMS support. In fact, all the cloud-based services (Saas, Iaas and Paas) today have come to be called as IMS services.</p>

<strong>IMS includes following designations:</strong>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li> <strong>System Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating, troubleshooting Windows/Linux/Unix servers, desktops and laptops</li>
	<li><strong>Network Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting of network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Database Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting databases.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p> In addition to the above mentioned four major career paths, there are a few more options in IT. They are:</p>

<h4> Quality Analyst</h4>
<p>This primarily includes manual testing. Manual testers closely work with the development team for debugging the code.</p>
		
<h4> Enterprise Resource Planning</h4>

<p>Large enterprises use ERP software to manage their business activities. ERP applications help businesses make data-driven and coordinated decisions so that wasteful use of resources is avoided. Some of the ERP applications include:</p>		
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li> SAP</li>
		<li>Oracle Apps</li>
		<li>JD Edwards</li>
		<li>PeopleSoft</li>
	</ul>
		
	<strong>In ERP domain, there are three roles primarily. They are:</strong>
	
	<p> Technical Consultant – Deals with technical aspects such as coding, testing, DB administration, etc.</p>	
		
	<p>Functional Consultant – Deals with requirement gathering from client, planning, implementation, validation, end-user training, etc. It resembles the role of a Business Analyst.</p>	
		
		<p>Techno-functional Consultant – Includes both technical and functional tasks.</p>
		
		
		<p> The above list includes all different careers which a fresher can enter into. However, there are specific designations which are reserved for experienced people. A brief description of different roles and what they hold for Freshers:</p>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> Programming – Many opportunities for Freshers</li>
		<li>SQL with Unix – Support</li>
		<li>Testing – Please note that Freshers can only get into manual testing. Many dubious institutes in Ameerpet claim that Freshers can get into automated testing. We strongly advise that Freshers should not waste their time learning tools such as QTP as no company hires Freshers for these roles because of work as an automated tester, one needs to have a minimum of 1 year of experience in manual testing.</li>

Nowadays many people are looking for IT jobs even though they are from non IT branches. The skills one should have to get a software job are </p>
    
<ul style="line-height:200%">

<li> One programming language (C or JAVA)</li>
<li>Data base concepts</li>
<li>  Basics of Linux operating system</li>
<li>Good problem solving and analytical skills</li>

                                <li><strong>Well-paying job –</strong> IT industry offers very competitive salaries. On an average, the salary paid to a software engineer is definitely far more than that is paid to non-IT employees.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Great scope to learn – </strong>Technology is progressing at a rapid pace and every company is in a continuous battle with its competitors. Continuous learning is sine qua non (absolutely essential) for someone who wants to continue and make progress in the IT industry. Also, the more you learn, the more your market value will increase.</li>
                                <li><strong>Desk job –</strong> Unlike entry-level jobs for Civil, Mechanical and Electrical engineers, IT engineers need not exert physically for performing their job well. Though it is cited as a cause of many lifestyle diseases among techies, desk job is still preferred by most people.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Onsite opportunities –</strong> Most major service-based IT companies have good number of onsite opportunities. The company will bear all the expenses for your visit to client’s location. Such kinds of opportunities are rare for other entry-level engineering jobs.</li>

                                    <li><p><strong>At least one programming language</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is generally believed by students that they should master an advanced programming language like Java. However, companies do not expect freshers to be experts in anything. They only expect them to be strong in basics of what they have learnt in college. So, it is advised that students thoroughly revise basics of whichever language (C, C++, Java, etc.) they have studied in college.

                            <p>Since it is not guaranteed that you will be given the role of a developer only, you need to be prepared with basics of database also.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p><strong>UNIX scripting commands</strong></p>
                            <p>Since most of the servers are Unix-based, employees working in any role are required to have basic knowledge of UNIX commands as they have work on such servers at some time or another. Moreover, freshers may also be taken in the role of UNIX administrator in which they are supposed have a sound understanding on UNIX scripting concepts.

                                <p>In addition to the above, you need to have strong arithmetic and reasoning skills to become a good programmer. The standard book for refreshing these skills is R S Agarwal. Further, you can solve puzzles by Shakuntala Devi and other noted authors.

                                <ul style="line-height:200%">
                                <li>Most students generally study only for exams. Only in 4th year they focus on placements. However, it is advised that students should study constantly keep revising the concepts of ‘C’ and Java.</li>
                                <li>Since C is studied in the first year itself, students should keep practicing C programs in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years also.</li>
                                <li>By the time you study Java in the 2nd year, you must be thorough with basic concepts of programming.</li>
                                <li>In 3rd or 4th year, try to develop a simple application based on Java. Ensure that everything from front-end to back-end is developed by you. The idea is to get a clear picture of complete application development process.</li>

                          <p style="margin-top:-2px">Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h2>What to study for interviews?</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:150%">
    
        <li><strong>Technical – </strong>Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Reasoning – </strong>R S Agarwal</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

	    <div class="tab-content paragraph-style pull-left text-left">
		<h3 style="margin-top:-2px">Careers in IT can be classified under the following heads:</h3>
		<img src="..\images\eee\cse-it-itjobs-ui.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:10px;width:300px">

	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> User Interface (UI)</li>
		<li>Middleware</li>
		<li>Database</li>
		<li>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</li>
	
	</ul>
	<p>Each of the above career paths are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>A user interface designer’s primary responsibility is to design software applications, websites, mobile apps, etc. with a view to enhance user experience and engagement. The most important rule is end-user, since the success of a software or an app depends largely on its design. The job of a UI designer entails understanding both computer programming and graphic design. UI designers collaborate with product managers and developers to define and implement solutions for the product direction, visuals and experience. Once the creation of a website is complete, designers maintain and make necessary changes to the website when required.
</p>
	
	<strong>The Technologies on which UI designers/engineers work area:</strong>
	
<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Photoshop</li>
		<li>Scripting languages – PHP, Java scripting</li>
		<li>Angular JS</li>
		<li>Word Press, Jhumla, etc., which are useful for web designing</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Middleware</h3>

         <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-middleware.jpg" style="float:right">  
		
		<p>Middleware acts as intermediary between the front-end (UI) and database. It is also used for connecting different components of software or different applications. Middleware technologies include </p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>.Net</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Node JS and</li>
			<li>Ruby, among others.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you wish to become a developer, you have to invest your efforts in learning any of the aforementioned technologies.</p>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
		  <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-database.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;height:270px">   
		<p>Database developers and administrators play a very important role in any company which is driven by data. All the data that an application gathers will be stored in a database and it is DB developers and administrators who design the database, decide how this data should be organized and test the database applications.</p>
		
		
		<p>Following are roles for Freshers in database development and administration:</p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:150%">
			<li>PL/SQL developer</li>
			<li>Database Administrator (DBA) (includes application support)</li>
			<li>DB Tools – Warehousing (ETL/OLAP), Mining</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h3>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</h3>

         <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-networking.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px">  
		<p>In addition to developers, testers, database engineers, an IT company also require personnel for managing their IT infrastructure such as servers, network devices, desktop/laptops, etc. IMS staff supports others by resolving their issues with IT infrastructure. However, since 2008-9, many IT companies US and Europe-based companies have started outsourcing IMS services. As a result, many major IT companies in India such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc. now provide remote (cloud-based) IMS support. In fact, all the cloud-based services (Saas, Iaas and Paas) today have come to be called as IMS services.</p>

<strong>IMS includes following designations:</strong>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li> <strong>System Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating, troubleshooting Windows/Linux/Unix servers, desktops and laptops</li>
	<li><strong>Network Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting of network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Database Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting databases.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p> In addition to the above mentioned four major career paths, there are a few more options in IT. They are:</p>

<h4> Quality Analyst</h4>
<p>This primarily includes manual testing. Manual testers closely work with the development team for debugging the code.</p>
		
<h4> Enterprise Resource Planning</h4>

<p>Large enterprises use ERP software to manage their business activities. ERP applications help businesses make data-driven and coordinated decisions so that wasteful use of resources is avoided. Some of the ERP applications include:</p>		
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li> SAP</li>
		<li>Oracle Apps</li>
		<li>JD Edwards</li>
		<li>PeopleSoft</li>
	</ul>
		
	<strong>In ERP domain, there are three roles primarily. They are:</strong>
	
	<p> Technical Consultant – Deals with technical aspects such as coding, testing, DB administration, etc.</p>	
		
	<p>Functional Consultant – Deals with requirement gathering from client, planning, implementation, validation, end-user training, etc. It resembles the role of a Business Analyst.</p>	
		
		<p>Techno-functional Consultant – Includes both technical and functional tasks.</p>
		
		
		<p> The above list includes all different careers which a fresher can enter into. However, there are specific designations which are reserved for experienced people. A brief description of different roles and what they hold for Freshers:</p>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> Programming – Many opportunities for Freshers</li>
		<li>SQL with Unix – Support</li>
		<li>Testing – Please note that Freshers can only get into manual testing. Many dubious institutes in Ameerpet claim that Freshers can get into automated testing. We strongly advise that Freshers should not waste their time learning tools such as QTP as no company hires Freshers for these roles because of work as an automated tester, one needs to have a minimum of 1 year of experience in manual testing.</li>

                                <li><strong>Well-paying job –</strong> IT industry offers very competitive salaries. On an average, the salary paid to a software engineer is definitely far more than that is paid to non-IT employees.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Great scope to learn – </strong>Technology is progressing at a rapid pace and every company is in a continuous battle with its competitors. Continuous learning is sine qua non (absolutely essential) for someone who wants to continue and make progress in the IT industry. Also, the more you learn, the more your market value will increase.</li>
                                <li><strong>Desk job –</strong> Unlike entry-level jobs for Civil, Mechanical and Electrical engineers, IT engineers need not exert physically for performing their job well. Though it is cited as a cause of many lifestyle diseases among techies, desk job is still preferred by most people.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Onsite opportunities –</strong> Most major service-based IT companies have good number of onsite opportunities. The company will bear all the expenses for your visit to client’s location. Such kinds of opportunities are rare for other entry-level engineering jobs.</li>

                                    <li><p><strong>At least one programming language</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>It is generally believed by students that they should master an advanced programming language like Java. However, companies do not expect freshers to be experts in anything. They only expect them to be strong in basics of what they have learnt in college. So, it is advised that students thoroughly revise basics of whichever language (C, C++, Java, etc.) they have studied in college.
                            </p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p><strong>Database management system i.e. DML, DDL and DCL commands. </strong></p> 
                            <p>Since it is not guaranteed that you will be given the role of a developer only, you need to be prepared with basics of database also.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p><strong>UNIX scripting commands</strong></p>
                            <p>Since most of the servers are Unix-based, employees working in any role are required to have basic knowledge of UNIX commands as they have work on such servers at some time or another. Moreover, freshers may also be taken in the role of UNIX administrator in which they are supposed have a sound understanding on UNIX scripting concepts.
                            </p>

                                <p>In addition to the above, you need to have strong arithmetic and reasoning skills to become a good programmer. The standard book for refreshing these skills is R S Agarwal. Further, you can solve puzzles by Shakuntala Devi and other noted authors.
                            </p>

                                <ul style="line-height:200%">
                                <li>Most students generally study only for exams. Only in 4th year they focus on placements. However, it is advised that students should study constantly keep revising the concepts of ‘C’ and Java.</li>
                                <li>Since C is studied in the first year itself, students should keep practicing C programs in 2nd, 3rd and 4th years also.</li>
                                <li>By the time you study Java in the 2nd year, you must be thorough with basic concepts of programming.</li>
                                <li>In 3rd or 4th year, try to develop a simple application based on Java. Ensure that everything from front-end to back-end is developed by you. The idea is to get a clear picture of complete application development process.</li>
                                
                                </ul>

                          <p style="margin-top:-2px">Though interviews are generally held in the fourth year of B.Tech or immediately after you graduate, it is advised that student should start preparing for interviews right from the third year. When you are in college or just graduated, expectations of companies from you are usually low. It is just expected that you know the basics well. On the other hand, if you are attending an interview after 6 months or more after graduation, the interviewer will expect that you have done a little more than what you have studied in college.</p>
    
    <h2>What to study for interviews?</h2>
    <p>As discussed above, you need to be strong with the basics of at least one programming language, database and UNIX commands. Preparation for interviews can be classified as follows</p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:150%">
    
        <li><strong>Technical – </strong>Which is already discussed in detail above</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Reasoning – </strong>R S Agarwal</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Skills – </strong>This includes oral communication, body language, official letter/email drafting, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>You need to focus on improving all the three skills. As it is a time-taking process, you should start early (i.e. at least by third year second semester), especially if you are poor in one or more of the above mentioned skills.</p>
    
    <h4>Where to take recruitment training?</h4>
    
    <p>Unfortunately,there is not even a single institute in Hyderabad which acts as a finishing school for those graduating in engineering. We have thousands of engineers with good grades but poor technical and soft skills.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;	So, you need to gather skills from your college, friends and others.</p>

	    <div class="tab-content paragraph-style pull-left text-left">
		<h3 style="margin-top:-2px">Careers in IT can be classified under the following heads:</h3>
		<img src="..\images\eee\cse-it-itjobs-ui.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:10px;width:300px">

	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> User Interface (UI)</li>
		<li>Middleware</li>
		<li>Database</li>
		<li>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</li>
	
	</ul>
	<p>Each of the above career paths are discussed below.</p>
	
	<h3>User Interface</h3>
	<p>A user interface designer’s primary responsibility is to design software applications, websites, mobile apps, etc. with a view to enhance user experience and engagement. The most important rule is end-user, since the success of a software or an app depends largely on its design. The job of a UI designer entails understanding both computer programming and graphic design. UI designers collaborate with product managers and developers to define and implement solutions for the product direction, visuals and experience. Once the creation of a website is complete, designers maintain and make necessary changes to the website when required.
</p>
	
	<strong>The Technologies on which UI designers/engineers work area:</strong>
	
<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Photoshop</li>
		<li>Scripting languages – PHP, Java scripting</li>
		<li>Angular JS</li>
		<li>Word Press, Jhumla, etc., which are useful for web designing</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3>Middleware</h3>

         <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-middleware.jpg" style="float:right">  
		
		<p>Middleware acts as intermediary between the front-end (UI) and database. It is also used for connecting different components of software or different applications. Middleware technologies include </p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:200%">
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>.Net</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Node JS and</li>
			<li>Ruby, among others.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you wish to become a developer, you have to invest your efforts in learning any of the aforementioned technologies.</p>
		
		<h3>Database</h3>
		  <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-database.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;width:350px;height:270px">   
		<p>Database developers and administrators play a very important role in any company which is driven by data. All the data that an application gathers will be stored in a database and it is DB developers and administrators who design the database, decide how this data should be organized and test the database applications.</p>
		
		
		<p>Following are roles for Freshers in database development and administration:</p>
		
		<ul style="line-height:150%">
			<li>PL/SQL developer</li>
			<li>Database Administrator (DBA) (includes application support)</li>
			<li>DB Tools – Warehousing (ETL/OLAP), Mining</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		<h3>Infrastructure Management Services (IMS)</h3>

         <img src="..\images\eee\cse-itjobs-networking.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:20px">  
		<p>In addition to developers, testers, database engineers, an IT company also require personnel for managing their IT infrastructure such as servers, network devices, desktop/laptops, etc. IMS staff supports others by resolving their issues with IT infrastructure. However, since 2008-9, many IT companies US and Europe-based companies have started outsourcing IMS services. As a result, many major IT companies in India such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, etc. now provide remote (cloud-based) IMS support. In fact, all the cloud-based services (Saas, Iaas and Paas) today have come to be called as IMS services.</p>

<strong>IMS includes following designations:</strong>
<ul style="line-height:200%">
	<li> <strong>System Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating, troubleshooting Windows/Linux/Unix servers, desktops and laptops</li>
	<li><strong>Network Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting of network devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Database Administration – </strong>Deals with configuration, updating and troubleshooting databases.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p> In addition to the above mentioned four major career paths, there are a few more options in IT. They are:</p>

<h4> Quality Analyst</h4>
<p>This primarily includes manual testing. Manual testers closely work with the development team for debugging the code.</p>
		
<h4> Enterprise Resource Planning</h4>

<p>Large enterprises use ERP software to manage their business activities. ERP applications help businesses make data-driven and coordinated decisions so that wasteful use of resources is avoided. Some of the ERP applications include:</p>		
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%">
		<li> SAP</li>
		<li>Oracle Apps</li>
		<li>JD Edwards</li>
		<li>PeopleSoft</li>
	</ul>
		
	<strong>In ERP domain, there are three roles primarily. They are:</strong>
	
	<p> Technical Consultant – Deals with technical aspects such as coding, testing, DB administration, etc.</p>	
		
	<p>Functional Consultant – Deals with requirement gathering from client, planning, implementation, validation, end-user training, etc. It resembles the role of a Business Analyst.</p>	
		
		<p>Techno-functional Consultant – Includes both technical and functional tasks.</p>
		
		
		<p> The above list includes all different careers which a fresher can enter into. However, there are specific designations which are reserved for experienced people. A brief description of different roles and what they hold for Freshers:</p>
	
	
	<ul style="line-height:200%"> 
		<li> Programming – Many opportunities for Freshers</li>
		<li>SQL with Unix – Support</li>
		<li>Testing – Please note that Freshers can only get into manual testing. Many dubious institutes in Ameerpet claim that Freshers can get into automated testing. We strongly advise that Freshers should not waste their time learning tools such as QTP as no company hires Freshers for these roles because of work as an automated tester, one needs to have a minimum of 1 year of experience in manual testing.</li>
