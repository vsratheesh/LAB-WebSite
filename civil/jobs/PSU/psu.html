      <p style="margin-top:-2px">Most of the PSU companies recruit students on the basis of GATE score. So you need to prepare well for GATE exam. As the competition is very tough you need to put the best efforts to get the job in PSUs.  Apart from core subjects you need to learn general awareness, English and aptitude, in civil engineering most important topics are strength of material, manufacturing, applied thermodynamics.</p>
    
    <p>If your aim is to get in to PSUs make sure that you get a rank below 200 in GATE. To get good rank in GATE you have to answer maximum questions and score more. While preparing for GATE it is advisable not to skip any subjects to get good score. Try to solve previous year GATE papers it will help you a lot, you will get clear idea about important topics and difficulty level by solving previous papers. Always revise the studied topics.</p>
    
    <p>PSUs majorly hire through GATE, though they have immediate requirement they will hire through previous GATE score and suppose to attend Personal or Group discussion, but the short listing criteria will be GATE rank.</p>
