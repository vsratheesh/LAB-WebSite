	  </p>
	  
	  <p> If you are interested to move into any leadership roles or already you have started a leadership role and need help in doing that role, then MBA is recommended for you. Having work experience before pursuing MBA will be an advantage for you. </p>
    <p> MBA is the best option for you If you are not interested to get in to any programming role after B.Tech in Civil. Try to crack CAT if you are planning for 2 years management course from a well established college. But, it is not that easy to crack CAT, you should get 90%le in order to get into IIMS.</p>

                   <p>Civil Engineering is related with development and erection of buildings, roads, dams, fundamental landscapes etc. A bachelor in Civil Engineering will give awareness to design the simple plan and construct a structure. Whereas Master’s in Civil engineering will give the awareness of multifaceted designs and plans, materials and technologies of constructions. A Masters in Civil engineering will give the aptitude to become a master in Construction Engineering.</p>

		<p> Isn't this the first aspect that comes to your mind when you think about studying MS abroad? While a degree abroad isn't shabby for middle class students from India, no doubt there are some international degrees that are less expensive than the others. Indeed, you must add up a list of costs when you decide to study abroad. It can burn a hole in your pocket. If you plan well, you can restrain the damages to the pocket and not end up smouldering the entire shirt. Remember that education is an investment and students have done brilliantly well, not only recovering costs but have even made fortunes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The cost of studying abroad can be divided into the following</strong></p>
    
   <ul style="line-height:200%">
        <li>English Proficiency Tests-TOEFL/IELTS/PTE</li>
        <li>Graduate Level Admission Tests-GRE </li>
        <li>Application fees for the universities you apply</li>
        <li>Forwarding of test scores to universities (if any)</li>
        <li>WES Evaluation</li>
        <li>Courier Expenses</li>
        <li>Visa and SEVIS fees</li>
        <li>MS Tuition Costs in USA</li>
        <li>Student Airfare Costs</li>
        <li>Cost of living </li>        
    </ul>
    
    <p>
All in all, with all the individual expenses that the average cost of a <strong>MS</strong> for international students would be around $36,000 (minimum) depending on the choices you make. Besides the huge numbers you see here, it is not strange to see well planned students who get into great <strong>MS</strong> colleges with full-grants and graduate with negligible (if not zero) debt.</p>

		 <p>The truth is that you will be supported by everyone if you tell them what you want to do in career. It is greatest for you to plan far ahead rather than speeding up in last minute and gaming on something like game of chance. Take some time, when you are two years left from graduating from B.tech, and make a decision what way you want to go in your life.</p>
	
	<p>Penn down your goals your goals, vision, what you want to do and think of it every time even when you sleep. Do not ever hesitate to seek advices from your seniors, friends, family, cousins, and professors. Talking to somebody about your views is the best idea always.</p>
	
	<p>Put together a rough plan and think through it. One of the things that we have noticed with international students is NOT scheduling in advance of time. Students decide to study MS in US in the last hour and say I do not have time to prepare. They start depending on Google for uncertain questions like How to prepare for GRE in one month? That’s absolutely WRONG, never ever do that.</p>
	

	<p>Do you think scheduling 2 years ahead of time is important or should it be 3 years?</p>
	
	<p>And after everything is set profile evaluation in the most important task for applying for any university in US. There are many paid tools on internet but here is a free tool for your profile evaluation.<a href="http://www.profileevaluator.com/" target="_blank"><strong>www.profileevaluator.com </strong></a> 
	
	is a free online profile evaluator with over 13,000 registered profiles. Good Luck for your FUTURE IN USA.
