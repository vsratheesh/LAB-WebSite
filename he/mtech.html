        <li>There are two entrance exams <strong>GATE</strong> and <strong>PGECET</strong> to get an admission into M.Tech.</li>
        <li>Through <strong>GATE</strong> you can get admission in IITs, NITs etc. If you want to get placed in one of the top universities, then prepare to the hardest as the <strong>GATE</strong> score is most important.</li>
        <li><strong>PGECET</strong>  is a state owned examination conducted in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. You can join in universities like JNTU, OU and their affiliated colleges.</li>
        <li>Remember that the first priority always goes to a <strong>GATE</strong> qualified student rather than a <strong>PGECET</strong>  qualified student.</li>
        <li>PSUs like BHEL, ECIL and IOCL etc. will directly hire the candidates who qualify <strong>GATE</strong> with a good score.</li>
        <li>Remember candidates will be short listed on the basis of their <strong>GATE</strong> score. Candidates having an IIT B.Tech degree and having a CGPA/CPI score of 8 on 10 are exempted from requirement of <strong>GATE</strong> qualification.</li>

        <p>There are two entrance exams GATE and PGECET to get an admission into M.Tech.</p>

		
<p>Through GATE you can get admission in IITs, NITs etc. If you want to get placed in one of the top universities, then prepare to the hardest as the GATE score is most important.</p>

<p>PGECET is a state owned examination conducted in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. You can join in universities like JNTU, OU and their affiliated colleges.</p>

<p>Remember that the first priority always goes to a GATE qualified student rather than a PGECET qualified student.</p>
<p>PSUs like BHEL, ECIL and IOCL etc. will directly hire the candidates who qualify GATE with a good score.</p>

<p>Remember candidates will be short listed on the basis of their GATE score. Candidates having an IIT B.Tech degree and having a CGPA/CPI score of 8 on 10 are exempted from requirement of GATE qualification.</p>

<p>Let us get into the detailed information on how to get through these two entrance exams</p>

<p>Engineering Mathematics (It will have 13% of total marks weigh)</p>
<p>General Aptitude (will have 15% of total marks weigh)</p>
<p>Subject question (remaining 72% of total marks weigh)</p>


<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Any Engineering graduate is eligible to write GATE exam.</p>

<p><strong>
Age Limit:
</strong>  There is no age limit for the candidates who are ready to apply GATE Exam.</p>


<p><strong>How many times can you attempt?</strong>  </p>

<h4>Time Management:</h4>


<ul style="line-height:200%">

<li>It is better to start with 1 mark Questions (25 Questions). These questions are easy to attempt and will help in building confidence. Then go for 2 marks questions (around 8 questions). </li>
	<li>Now go for General aptitude section of 10 questions. All these will cover up to 43 questions attempted. All these should be done in a time of 100 to 110 minutes.</li>
	<li>In technical portion 22 questions are remaining, now you can complete these in 50 minutes comfortably. At the end keep 15 to 20 minutes time for a revision of the answer sheet to ensure all are correct.</li>
	
	
	<li><strong>While attempting the exam, leave the questions which you are not sure because </strong>
