          	Civil engineering is perhaps the oldest engineering branches of all the branches. It deals with a material, spatial and cultural product of human work that combines physical elements and energy and can be said as old as it is to be the first that a name that laid a piece of wood across a river to make  <br><span class="branch-text">it easier to crossways. </span><br><br>

       Many of us don’t worry about the used water, we mean where it goes after its purpose. Here comes old civil engineering Sanitary Engineering which has evolved into modern environmental engineering of such importance and it’s ironic that most of the academic departments have been changed the names to Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Civil engineering is an exhilarating profession as we can see the results of our own work at the end of the day. Let them be a bridge, a dwelling building, a subway station, or a hydroelectric dam.</p>

Also Transport Engineering is one more major key which is responsible for Roads, railroads, subway systems, and airports.

		Instrumentation Engineering is a specialized branch of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Instrumentation technology helps create, construct and maintain measuring and control devices and systems found in manufacturing plants and  <br><span class="branch-text">research institutions.</span><br><br>

        Any manufacturing demands Automation which requires sensing, monitoring and controlling of variables. Just imagine a world without instruments. It would be like traversing into a time that probably goes even beyond the Stone Age. Man has always been fascinated towards instruments and the quest to invent and innovate on new instruments has pushed mankind beyond barriers to an age where instruments have become a part and parcel of the life. Today, we find instruments at home and at workplace, and this was possible only because of the science instrumentation.</p>

		Mechanical Engineering is the largest of all engineering branches,including zones such as energy, fluid mechanics, dynamics, combustion, vibration, design, manufacturing process, systems modeling and replication, mechatronics, robotics, mechanics of material, rapid protottyping and combinations. <br><span class="branch-text">Mechanical engineering </span><br><br>

        is a miscellaneous subject that originates its scope from the necessity to design and producethe whole thing from small discrete parts and devices to huge systems. The part of a mechanical engineer is to take a creation from an idea to the open market. In order to achieve this, a wide-range of skills is obligatory.The mechanical engineer wants to attain specific skills and knowledge. He needs to realize the forces and the current situation that a creation, its parts,or its subsystems will meet; to project them for functionality,aesthetics,and the aptitude to endure the forces and the current situation they will be exposed to; and to control the best way to create them and confirm that they will function without a botch.Possibly that one skill for a mechanical engineer’s limited domain is the skill to examine and plan objects and systems with motion.

		  Mechanical engineering is the combination of creativity, knowledge and analytical tools to complete the difficult task of shaping an idea into reality. Mechanical engineering involves the application of generation, distribution, and use of energy; the processing of materials; the control and automation of manufacturing systems; the design and development of machines; and the solutions to environmental problems.
